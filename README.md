# react-rpg-example
Front end project for the RPG example with Slim

## Getting Started
First of all, it is important to notice that the backend URI that this project will be fetching at is not the common http://localhost:[PORT]/api/someroute. You might need to change just a few things on your pc such as your hosts file and also just a few things on your web server (Nginx or Apache).

### Prerequisites

As every React project, we need to install some dependencies in order to run it. This is not a create-react-app boilerplate, it's a custom made but
yet very simple, and you can do it by using your favorite package manager.

```
[ yarn | npm i]
```

### Technologies

It is a simple project using Redux as the store management tool and no CSS Frameworks were needed, it is developed 100% using pure CSS rules with the amazing library styled-components.

It uses client-side rendering with Reach/Router, and the back end for this project is developed with Slim Framework (PHP) and a MySQL database.
